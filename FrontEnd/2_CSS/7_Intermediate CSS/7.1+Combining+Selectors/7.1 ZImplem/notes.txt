ways to combine selectors

.class htmlElem {
    css code
}

Group 
    -> applies to both selectors
    -> selector, selector {css code}
    example:
        
        h1, h2 {
            color: blueviolet;
        }

Child
    -> selects the direct child of another selector
    -> only one level deep
    -> slector > selector {css code}
    examples:

        div > p {
            color: firebrick;
        }

        .box > .done {
            color: yellow;
        }


Descendant
    -> applies the css on the descendant as long as it has a matching ancestor
    -> anscestor descendant {css code}
    -> selector selector {css code}
    examples:

    .box ul {
        color: green;
    }

    div li {
        color: blue;
    }    


Chaining
    -> apply where all selectors are true
    -> if you're looking to use an element, always start on an element, then add other selectors. This is because .doneli vs li.done ; The former can be mistaken for a class value of doneli
    -> selectorselector {css code}
    examples:

    li.done {
        color: seagreen;
    }



Each of these selectors can be combined with other selectors.
