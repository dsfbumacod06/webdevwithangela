If there are css rules targeting the same element. The hierarchy goes from:
External < Internal < Inline 
External being applied first, and inline being applied last, and therefore used in the end.


4 Broad Categories for determining the level of importance:
Position < Specificity < Type < Importance

-> Position
    example: 
        li {
            color: red;
            color: blue;
        }
        the color blue will be applied.
        the lower they are in the code, the more important they are.



-> Specificity
    -> refers to how specific a selector is.
    example:
    li {color: blue}
    .first-class {color: red}
    li[draggable] {color: purple}
    #first-id{color:orange}

    The example above is in order of hierarchy, going from least to most important.
    element < class < attribute < id

     
-> Type
    -> External < Internal < Inline

-> Importance
    -> !important keyword
    example:
    li {
        color: red;
        color green !important;
    }
